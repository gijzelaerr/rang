# Contributing to Rang

Contributions should make a scientific claim easier to reproduce, test or reject. Use Rust for numerical kernels and Python for interfaces, experiments and analysis.

## Local checks

Create the Python environment described in the README, then run all checks before committing:

```sh
.venv/bin/python -m pip --isolated install --index-url https://pypi.org/simple -e '.[pointing,beam,test]' ruff
cargo build --offline --release
cargo test --offline --release
cargo clippy --offline --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
.venv/bin/ruff check python examples tests
.venv/bin/ruff format --check python examples tests
git diff --check
```

## Scientific reporting

Use fenced `math` blocks for display equations and dollar-delimited LaTeX for
inline mathematics, following [GitHub's math formatting](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions).
Keep code identifiers in code spans rather than math delimiters.

The optional JAX tests are skipped when JAX is absent. Install the `pointing`
extra as above for full verification. JAX is the explicitly requested
automatic-differentiation reference path alongside the Rust core.

- Separate proposals, implemented algorithms and measured results.
- Record seeds, configuration, tolerances, provenance and executable or source revision.
- Match sky assumptions, priors, observations and tuning effort between baselines.
- Report absolute flux error, signal response, residual distortion and held-out prediction separately.
- Distinguish realization scatter from posterior uncertainty and confidence intervals.
- Preserve failures and null results. Do not select only favorable seeds.
- Cite the closest primary literature and identify the specific difference being tested.

Generated campaigns belong in ignored `outputs/`. Retain compact numerical summaries and reproduction commands in `research/`. Do not commit observational data without documenting provenance and redistribution terms.

## Reporting an issue

Include the command, configuration and seed, expected and observed behavior, Rust/Python versions, and a minimal reproducer. For scientific discrepancies, include the relevant control and identify whether the metric is measured in visibility or image space.
